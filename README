SFML Tetris Readme

A simple implementation of Tetris in C++ with SFML.
Once again, this was merely tinkering around in SFML
and exploring its functionality.

The rotations and collision detection were brute-forced 
and the entire game operates off of a basic 2-dimensional 
array that simulates the Tetris grid.

The rotation detection isn't complete (I attempted to figure
it out myself rather than looking at the actual standards which,
at the time, I didn't know actually existed).

Requirements: SFML 1.6, G++/GCC MinGW, Dev. environment to compile
(no Linux-specific calls).

Use make to compile.
