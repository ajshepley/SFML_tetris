# SFML Tetris Readme

## **Deprecated/ancient school project.**

A simple implementation of Tetris in C++ with SFML.
Once again, this was merely tinkering around in SFML and exploring its functionality.

The rotations and collision detection were brute-forced and the entire game operates off of a basic 2-dimensional array that simulates the Tetris grid.

The rotation detection isn't complete.

## Requirements

SFML 1.6, G++/GCC MinGW, Dev. environment to compile
(no Linux-specific calls).
